# Extract, Transform, and Load with Movie Data
## Project Overview
The following project involves using the ETL process to extract movie data from various sources, transforming the data, and then uploading the results into a PostgreSQL database. ETL is a powerful tool that ultimately allows us to leverage data from a variety of sources. After gathering data in the extraction process, we cleansed the data by applying regular expressions and other formatting tools to ensure the versatility of the data in the transformation phase. After transforming the movie data, we can manipulate and query the data to fit our needs. In the hypothetical scenario, we are tasked to streamline the data pipeline for the "Amazing Prime" streaming service by creating a function that can take in the extracted files, perform the necessary transformations, and then load the data into the database all in one go.
